## Register Table Store resources {#section_wff_snb_yfb .section}

Table Store is a NoSQL data storage service built on the Apsara system of Alibaba Cloud. It enables you to store and access large amounts of structured data in real time. Realtime Compute has high requirements on access delay, and has low requirements on the relational algebra. Therefore, Table Store dimension tables and result tables are very suitable for Realtime Compute.

**Note:** If you encounter errors that are similar to the `No Permission` error when you use Table Store, grant Realtime Compute the permission to access Table Store. For more information, see [Create a role for Realtime Compute exclusive mode and grant permissions to the role](../../../../intl.en-US/Preparation/Create a role for Realtime Compute exclusive mode and grant permissions to the role.md#).
