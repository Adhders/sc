# Publish {#concept_62481_zh .concept}

This topic describes how to publish a Realtime Compute job.

After you complete the development and debugging process, and verify that the Flink SQL code is correct, you can click **Publish** to publish the data to the production system.

## Procedure {#section_xvd_zdq_yfb .section}

1.  Configure resources.

    Select Automatic CU Configuration. If it is the first time that you publish a job, use the default number of CUs.

2.  Check the data.

    After you verify that no error exists, click **Next**.

3.  Publish a job.

    Click **Publish**.

4.  Start a job.

    Enter the Administration page, and click the job.

    **Note:** Realtime Compute completely isolates the development and production environments. All operations performed on the Realtime Compute development platform, such as modification and debugging, do not affect the production and debugging jobs on the data administration page.
