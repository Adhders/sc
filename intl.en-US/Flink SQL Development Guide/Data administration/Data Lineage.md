# Data Lineage {#concept_62489_zh .concept}

The data lineage of a Realtime Compute job reflects the dependency between the input and output data of the job. In scenarios where the business dependency between the input and output data of a job is complex, Realtime Compute provides a data topology on the Data Lineage page to clearly show the dependency.

## Data Sampling {#section_alf_qgs_bgb .section}

The Data Lineage page provides the data sampling feature for the source and result tables of jobs. This feature is consistent with that on the development platform. It allows you to detect data and locate problems on the data administration page at any time.

To enable the data sampling feature, click the source or result table name.
